*ScenarioGenerator* performs search-based software testing of [Baidu Apollo](https://apollo.auto) by automatic generation of various traffic scenarios in [SVL end-to-end autonomous vehicle.](https://www.svlsimulator.com) to verify and validate the safety functionality of Apollo autonomous systems. ScenarioGenerator project is started and is currently maintained by Hamid Ebadi.
